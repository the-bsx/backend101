## mvc pattern ---- model view controller

# controller ----
1. handle the request flow
2. never handles the data logics

# model ----
1. handles the data logic
2. interacts with database

# view ----
1. handlest the data presentation
2. dynamically rendered

# model and view never communicates with each other directly but they communicates through the controller

 like writing something new for the code okey!
